# TODO

*   Automatic shape computation
	*   Broadcasting
	*   What if shape depend on arguments?
*   What should be done at level of `T` vs. `TVal`?
*   Mapping
*   `tfold`, `tscan`, etc. for tensors
*   Make notation slightly more efficient than `x <- save $ ...`.
*   Add more functions!
*   Instance declarations right now require type annotations like `1::Int`. How to get around this?
*   Python interface
